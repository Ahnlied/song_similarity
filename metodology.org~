Methodology to determine song similarity

There are some parameters that characterizes a song, such as:

1. TONE COLOR/TIMBRE/INSTRUMENTATION
- percussion = instr. which is struck, (drums, bell, rattle, marimba, vibes, xylophone, glockenspiel, piano (because note sounded by striking hammer))

        strings (violin, viola, cello, double bass, guitar, harp etc.)

        brass (trumpet, trombone, French horn, tuba, etc.)

        woodwinds (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, etc. – last 4 = reeds, ob. & bsn. = double reeds vs. clar. & sax. = single reeds)

        voices (soprano, alto, tenor, bass, etc. or the medieval triplum, duplum, tenor)

        a.d.s.r. = attack-decay-sustain-release, a technical description of tone color, e.g. for synthesizer sound envelope design or analysis


    RHYTHM

        beat/pulse

        meter = group of beats, e.g. group of four beats–"4/4"–numerator is number of beats

        duple meter = a group of beats divisible by 2

        triple meter = a group of beats divisible by 3

        subdivision of individual beat can be duple or triple as well

        a duple meter with triple subdivision is called compound duple meter and, vice versa, compound triple meter has duple subdivision


    MELODY

        pitch + time = melody

        pitch: high/low = sound wave, frequency of vibration of air on eardrum

        melodic contour = a draw-able shape which shows perceived pitch height and rate of change

        phrases–cadence–climax–scales (scales also pertain to harmony)


    DYNAMICS/EXPRESSION

        loud/soft (forte/piano)

        legato/staccato (smooth/choppy or spiky), etc.



    TEXTURE (# OF INDEPENDENT PARTS)

        monophony (one melody)

        homophony (one main melody

        polyphony (many simultaneous melodies which seem to relate)

        heterophony (chaos–unrelated sounds or melodies)


    HARMONY

        consonant/consonance (pleasing) vs. dissonant/dissonance (jarring, tense, ugly, unsettling)

        cadence = ending, punctuation, as in speech

        tonal system vs. modal or pre-tonal, atonal, microtonal or post-tonal

        notes in scale or melody which play important harmonic roles

        tonic (home note)

        dominant (5 steps above tonic)

        subdominant (5 steps below tonic)


    FORM

        structure; music as architecture in space and time; musical similarity leads to symmetry

        large-scale repetition and contrast diagrammed as rhyme scheme, e.g. 'ABA' represents a form which returns to the opening phrase before closing (also called an arch or da capo form)

        strophic - 'AAA..etc.' like a song with verses, or a hymn

        through-composed - a form where repetition is indiscernible or overly intricate


    TEXT/EXTRAMUSICALITY

        use of words or other nonmusical ideas as essential part of piece vs. "absolute" music
